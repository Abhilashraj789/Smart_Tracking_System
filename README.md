Smart Tracking System for School Buses.

Description:
• Tool: Android studio.
• Database: SQL Lite.
• Programming Language: Android programming.

An Android based application designed and implemented to provide remote tracking and SMS mode of alert mechanism. The application is user friendly, interactive and secure, which uses Google API’s to fetch the current location and GPS to track the school bus in real time.
Our proposed system consists of 2 modules, The Administrator and The Parent. The proposed system involves intimating the parent, when the bus is about to approach the pickup/ drop point and also when the bus reaches the school. There is a provision for the bus administrator to send alerts to the authority in case of emergencies like tire puncture, engine problem. If there is any variation in the accelerometer readings, a precautionary SMS is sent to the authority and parent suspecting of an accident. The parent can also query the bus administrator about the current bus location or inform the administrator if the child is going to be absent on that particular day.
